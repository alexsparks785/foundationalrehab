Eight hours in a chair. Hunched over a laptop. Maybe you get up for coffee. Maybe.

By 3 PM, your lower back is screaming. By Friday, you can barely tie your shoes.

Sound familiar?

Here's the truth: **the human spine wasn't designed for sitting**. When you sit, especially with poor posture, you're putting up to 90% more pressure on your lumbar discs than when you're standing.

But you can't quit your job. So let's talk about damage control.

These 7 stretches take less than 5 minutes and can be done right at your desk—no yoga mat, no weird looks from coworkers. Do them every 2 hours, and your back will feel dramatically different by end of day.

## Why Sitting Destroys Your Lower Back

Before we get to the stretches, let's understand what's actually happening:

1. **Hip flexors shorten.** When you sit, your hip flexors (the muscles at the front of your hip) stay in a shortened position for hours. This pulls your pelvis forward and increases the curve in your lower back.

2. **Glutes shut off.** Your glutes—the muscles that should stabilize your pelvis—basically go to sleep when you sit. They forget how to fire properly.

3. **Spinal discs compress unevenly.** Sitting, especially slouching, puts asymmetric pressure on your intervertebral discs. Over time, this can lead to bulging or herniation.

4. **Core muscles disengage.** Without needing to stabilize you, your deep core muscles check out. When you finally stand up, they're not ready to support your spine.

The solution isn't just stretching—it's **interrupting the pattern**. Every 2 hours, you need to:
- Lengthen what's gotten short
- Activate what's gone dormant
- Decompress what's been compressed

That's exactly what these 7 stretches do.

## The 5-Minute Desk Reset

### 1. Standing Hip Flexor Stretch

**Why:** Counteracts hours of hip flexor shortening

**How:**
1. Stand up and take a step back with your right foot
2. Keep your back leg straight, front knee slightly bent
3. Tuck your pelvis under (think: belt buckle toward chin)
4. You should feel a stretch in the front of your right hip
5. Hold 30 seconds each side

**Desk tip:** Do this while reading emails on your phone—no one will notice.

---

### 2. Seated Spinal Twist

**Why:** Restores rotational mobility that gets locked up from sitting

**How:**
1. Sit sideways in your chair, feet flat on floor
2. Hold the back of the chair with both hands
3. Gently twist your torso toward the chair back
4. Keep your hips facing forward—only your upper body rotates
5. Hold 20 seconds, then switch sides

**Key point:** Don't force it. Twist only as far as comfortable.

---

### 3. Cat-Cow (Chair Version)

**Why:** Mobilizes the entire spine through flexion and extension

**How:**
1. Sit on the edge of your chair, feet flat, hands on knees
2. **Cow:** Inhale, arch your back, chest forward, look slightly up
3. **Cat:** Exhale, round your back, tuck chin, pull belly button in
4. Flow smoothly between positions
5. Repeat 10 times

**Breathing:** The breath drives the movement. Inhale = extension, exhale = flexion.

---

### 4. Seated Figure-4 Stretch

**Why:** Releases the piriformis and external hip rotators that tighten from sitting

**How:**
1. Sit tall, cross your right ankle over your left knee
2. Keep your right foot flexed (toes toward shin)
3. Gently press down on your right knee
4. For more stretch, hinge forward at the hips (keep back straight)
5. Hold 30 seconds each side

**Feel it:** Deep in the glute/hip area. If you feel it in your knee, adjust the angle.

---

### 5. Standing Back Extension

**Why:** Reverses the flexed position you've been in all day

**How:**
1. Stand up, place hands on your lower back (fingers pointing down)
2. Slowly lean backward, supporting your lower back with your hands
3. Go only as far as comfortable—this isn't a competition
4. Hold 5 seconds, return to neutral
5. Repeat 5 times

**Caution:** If you have spinal stenosis or extension-sensitive pain, skip this one.

---

### 6. Doorway Chest Stretch

**Why:** Opens the chest and shoulders that round forward from typing

**How:**
1. Stand in a doorway, forearms on the door frame
2. Elbows at shoulder height, 90-degree angle
3. Step one foot forward and lean through the doorway
4. You should feel it across your chest and front of shoulders
5. Hold 30 seconds

**Why it helps your back:** Rounded shoulders pull your thoracic spine into flexion, which forces your lumbar spine to compensate.

---

### 7. Glute Squeeze (Standing)

**Why:** Wakes up the glutes that have been dormant

**How:**
1. Stand tall, feet hip-width apart
2. Squeeze your glutes as hard as you can
3. Hold for 10 seconds
4. Release
5. Repeat 5 times

**Make it real:** This isn't a casual squeeze. Contract like you're trying to crack a walnut. Your glutes need to remember they exist.

## The 2-Hour Rule

Here's the protocol:

| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| Start of day | Full 5-minute routine |
| Every 2 hours | Pick 3-4 stretches, 2-3 minutes |
| End of day | Full 5-minute routine |

**Set a timer.** Seriously. You will not remember to do this otherwise. Every phone has a recurring alarm feature. Use it.

### Quick Combos (When You Only Have 2 Minutes)

**Combo A (Hip Focus):**
- Standing Hip Flexor Stretch (both sides)
- Glute Squeeze

**Combo B (Spine Focus):**
- Cat-Cow x 10
- Standing Back Extension x 5

**Combo C (Full Body):**
- Seated Spinal Twist (both sides)
- Figure-4 Stretch (both sides)

Rotate through these throughout the day.

## Beyond Stretching: Desk Setup Matters

Stretches help, but they can't overcome a terrible workstation. Quick fixes:

- **Monitor at eye level.** Your eyes should hit the top third of your screen without tilting your head.
- **Keyboard at elbow height.** Arms should hang naturally, elbows at 90 degrees.
- **Feet flat on floor.** If your chair is too high, get a footrest.
- **Lumbar support.** A small pillow or rolled towel in the curve of your lower back makes a huge difference.

## When Stretching Isn't Enough

These stretches are maintenance—they prevent bad from getting worse and provide temporary relief.

But if you're dealing with:
- Pain that radiates down your leg
- Numbness or tingling
- Pain that's getting progressively worse
- Pain that doesn't improve with movement

...you need more than desk stretches. You need a structured rehab program that addresses the root cause.

That's what Foundational Rehab is built for—progressive programs that rebuild your back from the ground up, not just band-aid stretches.

## The Bottom Line

Sitting is unavoidable for most of us. But the damage isn't inevitable.

**5 minutes every 2 hours.** That's all it takes to interrupt the pattern, keep your tissues mobile, and prevent that end-of-day back pain.

Set your timer. Do the stretches. Your future self will thank you.
